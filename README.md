# The Beginner's Guide to TypeScript

This is the repository that correlates to my book The Beginner's Guide to TypeScript, you can purchase the kindle book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Guide-TypeScript-Sam-Redmond-ebook/dp/B083C5S9LV/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=The+Beginner%27s+Guide+to+TypeScript&qid=1577981888&sr=8-2)

Each branch in this repository correlates to the code on display in each chapter of the book. The master branch is a bare-bones branch that each new project is branched off of.
