# The Beginner's Guide to TypeScript

This is the repository that correlates to my book The Beginner's Guide to TypeScript, you can purchase the kindle book at the link above.

Each branch in this repository correlates to the code on display in each chapter of the book. The master branch is a bare-bones branch that each new project is branched off of.
